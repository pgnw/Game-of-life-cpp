Conway's Game of Life

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This implementation provides an interactive graphical interface to visualize and interact with the simulation.

Features

    Interactive Visualization: View the simulation in real-time with graphical rendering using the SFML library.
    Manual Cell State Changes: Use the mouse to toggle the life state of individual cells.
    Pause and Resume: Control the simulation flow with the spacebar to pause and resume the game.
